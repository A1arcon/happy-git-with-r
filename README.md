THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT!

*Lots of dummy placeholder content is here, because I initialized this repo with the bookdown demo. It will gradually get removed.*

Trying this, gradually: bring (and expand) the STAT 545 content into [bookdown format](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), in anticipation of the tutorial at useR! 2016:

  * [session](http://schedule.user2016.org/event/7Bad/using-git-and-github-with-r-rstudio-and-r-markdown-part-1) in the useR! schedule
  * [full description](http://user2016.org/tutorials/01.html) on the main site
  * [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user) for a related talk I've given a couple times
  * [landing page](http://stat545.com/git00_index.html) for all most of the related stuff at [stat545.com](http://stat545.com/index.html)
