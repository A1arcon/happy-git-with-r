# Unsupported remote setups {#unsupported}

Just like the previous section about more favorable setups, we only consider a very constrained set of remotes:

* The remote is on GitHub.
* The remote is named `origin` or `upstream`.

This section exists as counterpoint to the previous. Here we provide more details on remote setups that usethis can't work with and suggest improvements. *2020-06 note: this currently refers to features in a development version of usethis. These features are not in v1.6.1 = the current CRAN version.*

*section coming soon*
