# Installation: One thing at a time

We need to set up several individual components and test individually, before we attempt to integrate:

  * Register a GitHub account, section \@ref(register-github).
  * Install or upgrade R and RStudio, section \@ref(register-github).
  * Install Git, section \@ref(register-github).
  * Install a Git client, section \@ref(register-github).

## Register a GitHub account {#register-github}

Register an account with GitHub. It's free!

  * <https://github.com>
  
You will be able upgrade to a paid level of service, apply discounts, join organizations, etc. in the future, so don't worry about any of that now. **Except your username. You should actually worry about that.**

A few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:

  * Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
  * Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
  * Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
  * Shorter is better than longer.
  * Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
  * Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence (like I have, sigh).
  * Avoid words laden with special meaning in computer programming. In my first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, I assigned lots of issues to [the guy with username `NA`](https://github.com/na) because my vector of GitHub usernames contained missing values. A variant of [Little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/).

You can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.
