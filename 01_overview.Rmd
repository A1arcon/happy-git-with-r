# Why Git? Why GitHub?

Data analysts can use the [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com) to manage a motley assortment of project files in a sane way (e.g., data, code, reports, etc.). This has benefits for the solo analyst and, especially, for anyone who wants to communicate and collaborate with others. Git helps you organize your project over time and across different people and computers. Hosting services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. A remote host like GitHub is critical for making your projects available for others to read or, perhaps, modify.

What's special about using R and Git(Hub)?

  * the active R package development community on GitHub
  * workflows for R scripts and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) files that make it easy to share source and rendered results on GitHub
  * Git- and GitHub-related features of the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/)

We target [GitHub](https://github.com) -- not [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) -- for the sake of specificity. However, all the big-picture principles and even some mechanics will carry over to these alternative hosting platforms.

<!-- 
[Git](http://git-scm.com) is a __version control system__. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files -- called a __repository__ -- in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, think of it as the "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but much, much better.

Git has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, reports, and, yes, source code.

When you want to make your work visible to other people, either in a read-only way or for genuine collaboration, you can make the associated Git repository available on the web. This can be totally public or private to your closest friends. Regardless, this reduces the extra work associated with sharing and collaboration almost to zero, which has huge benefits. [GitHub](https://github.com) is a very popular hosting site that provides this service (and more). If you have no idea what I'm talking about, think of it as DropBox but much better (at least for our purposes).

Full participation in the "data community" these days practically requires familiarity with Git and GitHub. These tools are also helpful to us for course logistics, such as sharing code between instructor and student. For both reasons, we will be using Git and GitHub. Below we explain how to install the Git software locally on your computer.

## Audience and pre-reqs

The target audience for this site is someone who analyzes data, probably with R, though much of the content may be useful to analysts using other languages. While R package development with Git(Hub) is absolutely in scope, it's not an explicit focus or requirement.

The site is aimed at intermediate to advanced R users, who are comfortable writing R scripts and managing R projects. You should have a good grasp of files and directories and be generally knowledgeable about where things live on your computer.

Although we will show alternatives for most Git operations, we will inevitably spend some time in the shell and we assume some prior experience. For example, you should know how to open up a shell, navigate to a certain directory, and list the files there. You should be comfortable using shell commands to view/move/rename files and to work with your command history.

## What this is NOT

We aim to teach novices about Git on a strict "need to know" basis. Git was built to manage development of the Linux kernel, which is probably very different from what you do. Most people need a small subset of Git's functionality and that will be our focus. If you want a full-blown exposition of Git as a directed acyclic graph or a treatise on the Git-Flow branching strategy, you will be sad.
