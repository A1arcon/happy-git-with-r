# Peculiar remote setups {#unsupported}

Just like the previous section about the most common setups, we only consider a very constrained set of remotes:

* The remote is on GitHub.
* The remote is named `origin` or `upstream`.

This section exists as counterpoint to the previous. Here we provide more details on remote setups that are more unusual and, usually, not very functional. In general, these are setups usethis cannot work with. We try to suggest a better alterntive in each case. *2020-06 note: this currently refers to features in a development version of usethis. These features are not in v1.6.1 = the current CRAN version.*

*section coming soon*
